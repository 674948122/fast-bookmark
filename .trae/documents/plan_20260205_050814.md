The issue is caused by the `fetchBookmarks` function in `content.js` not re-executing the search query after fetching updated bookmark data. When a bookmark is edited or deleted, the background script notifies the content script to refresh data. However, the content script simply re-initializes the search index but keeps the old search results (`results` array) and renders them.

I will modify `content.js` to re-run the search query if one exists after refreshing the bookmarks.

**Plan:**

1. **Edit** **`content.js`**:

   * Locate the `fetchBookmarks` function.

   * Inside the callback for `getBookmarks` message, after `initFuse()` is called:

     * Check if `searchInput.value` is not empty.

     * If it is not empty, re-run the search using `fuse.search(searchInput.value)` and update the `results` variable.

   * This ensures that when `renderResults()` is called immediately after, it displays the up-to-date search results.

**Code Change Preview:**

```javascript
    // Fetch bookmarks
    function fetchBookmarks() {
        chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "getBookmarks" }, (response) => {
            bookmarks = response.flattened;
            bookmarkTree = response.tree;
            folders = response.folders || [];
            initFuse();

            
```
