I will add faint vertical hierarchy lines to the bookmark tree to help users distinguish folder levels.

1.  **Modify `content.js`**:
    *   Update `updateStyles` to add CSS for `.fast-bookmark-children-container`.
        *   This class will use a pseudo-element `::before` to draw a 1px vertical line.
        *   The line's horizontal position will be calculated dynamically using a CSS variable `--tree-level` (`calc(var(--tree-level) * 24px + 23px)`).
        *   The color will be `var(--text-color)` with low opacity (0.15) for a subtle effect.
    *   Update `renderNode` to apply this class and the `--tree-level` variable to the nested `ul` elements created for folder children.

This will create a vertical line extending down from each expanded folder's toggle, visually grouping its children.
