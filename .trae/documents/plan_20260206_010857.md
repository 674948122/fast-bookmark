I will modify `manifest.json` to add the `host_permissions` field.

The error "Extension manifest must request permission to access this host" indicates that the extension lacks the necessary permissions to programmatically inject scripts into the specific URL (in this case, a local IP address), even with `activeTab`.

In Manifest V3, the recommended way to grant the extension access to run scripts on all websites (including local ones) via `chrome.scripting` is to explicitly declare the hosts in `host_permissions`.

**Plan:**
1.  Edit `manifest.json`.
2.  Add `"host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"]` to the top-level configuration.

This will authorize the extension to inject its content script into any page, resolving the access error.
