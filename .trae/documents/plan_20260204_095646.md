I will restore compatibility with other New Tab extensions (like Infinity) by removing the native New Tab override and reverting to the "Launcher Tab" approach for restricted pages.

**Explanation:**
Chrome only allows **one** extension to override the New Tab page at a time. By adding `"chrome_url_overrides"` to our `manifest.json`, we forced Chrome to use our empty page, which disabled your Infinity New Tab extension.
To be compatible with Infinity (or any other New Tab replacement), we must:
1.  **Stop overriding the New Tab page** in our extension.
2.  **Handle the "Restricted Page" issue** gracefully: Since Infinity's page (`chrome-extension://...`) is also a restricted page where we can't inject scripts directly, clicking our extension icon while on the Infinity page won't work by default.
3.  **Re-enable the "Launcher" solution**: When you click our icon while on the Infinity page, we will detect it's a restricted page and open our `launcher.html` in a new tab (as implemented previously). This ensures you can still use the bookmark search even if you can't inject it directly over Infinity.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Modify `manifest.json`**: Remove the `"chrome_url_overrides"` section.
2.  **Modify `background.js`**: Update the restricted URL check to explicitly include `chrome-extension://` schemes (except our own, if needed, but usually clicking the icon on *another* extension's page is restricted). Specifically, verify if `chrome-extension://dbfmnekepjoapopniengjbcpnbljalfg/` needs special handling or if the general check covers it.
    *   *Self-correction*: The previous check `tab.url.startsWith("chrome://")` covers internal pages. Extension pages start with `chrome-extension://`. We should add `chrome-extension://` to the restricted list in `background.js` to trigger the Launcher fallback.
3.  **Clean up**: Delete `newtab.html` as it's no longer needed.

**Plan Steps:**
1.  Remove `newtab.html`.
2.  Update `manifest.json` to remove the override.
3.  Update `background.js` to treat `chrome-extension://` URLs as restricted (triggering the Launcher).

This restores your Infinity New Tab as the default start page, while ensuring Fast Bookmark can still be accessed via the Launcher when needed.
