I will implement a "Sort by Visit Frequency" feature for bookmarks.

**Plan:**

1.  **Modify `background.js`**:
    *   Update the `openBookmark` message handler to accept a `bookmarkId`.
    *   Implement logic to track visit counts in `chrome.storage.local` (key: `bookmarkVisitCounts`).
    *   Add a message handler (or update `getBookmarks`) to retrieve these counts. (I will assume `content.js` can read `storage.local` directly for counts, or request them. Since `content.js` is a content script, it can read `storage.local` but `storage.sync` is for settings. I'll stick to messaging or direct read if permission allows. Content scripts can read `storage.local`.)

2.  **Modify `content.js`**:
    *   **Internationalization**: Add translation keys for "Sort Order", "Default", "Most Visited".
    *   **Settings UI**: Add a "Sort Order" dropdown to the settings modal.
    *   **Settings Logic**: Store `sortOrder` in `chrome.storage.sync` (default: `'default'`).
    *   **Tracking**: Update `openBookmark` function to send the bookmark's `id` to the background script when clicked.
    *   **Sorting Logic**:
        *   In `fetchBookmarks`, retrieve the visit counts from `storage.local`.
        *   Implement a `sortBookmarks(nodes, counts, sortOrder)` function.
        *   If `sortOrder` is `'frequency'`:
            *   Keep folders at the top (usability best practice).
            *   Sort files (bookmarks) by visit count (descending).
            *   Use original index/title as tie-breaker.
        *   If `sortOrder` is `'default'`: Keep original order.
    *   **Rendering**: Ensure `renderResults` uses the sorted tree.

**User Interaction:**
*   User goes to Settings -> Selects "Most Visited" -> Bookmarks reorder based on usage.
*   Clicking a bookmark increases its count.

I will start by modifying `background.js` to handle the counting, then `content.js` for the UI and logic.
