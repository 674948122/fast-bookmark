I will fix the frequent message sending failure in `background.js` by improving the communication mechanism between the background script and the injected content script.

**Analysis:**
The issue occurs because `chrome.scripting.executeScript` returns when the script *injection* is complete, but it does **not** guarantee that the script has finished executing or initializing its message listeners.
Currently, the code waits for a fixed `100ms` (`setTimeout(..., 100)`) before sending the "toggle" message.
If the browser is busy, or the page is complex, `content.js` might take longer than 100ms to register `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener`. When `background.js` sends the message before the listener is ready, it fails (catches error).

**Proposed Solution: Polling / Retry Mechanism**
Instead of a single fixed wait, we should implement a robust retry mechanism:
1.  Try to send the message.
2.  If it fails, wait a short interval (e.g., 50ms) and try again.
3.  Repeat this for a reasonable timeout (e.g., 1-2 seconds).
4.  Only log an error if it still fails after max retries.

This "Exponential Backoff" or "Polling" approach is much more reliable for asynchronous injection scenarios.

**Plan Steps:**
1.  Refactor the message sending logic in `background.js` into a helper function `sendMessageWithRetry`.
2.  Replace the simple `setTimeout` with this retry logic.

This will significantly reduce the "Failed to toggle" errors and make the extension feel snappier (as it will succeed as *soon* as ready, rather than waiting a fixed time).
