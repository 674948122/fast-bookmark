I will fix the issue where the extension fails to open after long periods of inactivity by handling "Zombie" DOM elements.

**The Problem:**
When the extension is updated, reloaded, or sometimes after browser sleep/wake cycles that invalidate the extension context:
1.  The previous "Isolated World" (where the content script lived) is destroyed.
2.  However, the **DOM element** (`#fast-bookmark-container`) created by that script remains on the webpage.
3.  When you click the icon again, the background script detects the failure to communicate and re-injects `content.js`.
4.  The new `content.js` runs in a **new** Isolated World.
5.  It checks `document.getElementById("fast-bookmark-container")`. It finds the *old* (zombie) element.
6.  It assumes "Already injected" and exits immediately.
7.  Result: The new script never attaches event listeners, and the old element is dead (listeners detached). The extension appears broken.

**The Solution:**
I will update `content.js` to distinguish between "already running in this context" and "orphaned DOM from a dead context".

1.  **Context Check**: Use a global variable (e.g., `window.__fastBookmarkRunning`) to check if the script is active in the *current* execution context.
2.  **Cleanup Logic**: If the script is *not* active in the current context but the DOM element exists, assume it's a zombie element from a previous session. **Remove it** and proceed with fresh initialization.
3.  **Clean Up Deprecated Code**: Remove references to `newtab.html` since we reverted that feature.

**Plan Steps:**
1.  Modify `content.js` to implement the Zombie DOM cleanup logic.
2.  Remove `isNewTab` checks.

This ensures that whenever the background script injects the content script (which happens on wake-up/error recovery), it successfully re-initializes the UI.
