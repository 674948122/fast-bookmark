I will fix the issue where the settings modal remains open when the sidebar is toggled off and on again.

1.  **Modify `content.js`**:
    -   Locate the `toggle` function.
    -   In the "hide" branch (when `isVisible` becomes `false`), I will add logic to reset the UI state.
    -   Specifically, I will set `settingsModal.style.display = "none"` to ensure the settings page is closed when the sidebar is hidden.
    -   I will also ensure any other modal states (like edit or delete modals) are reset if necessary, to provide a clean state when reopened.

This ensures that every time the user opens the bookmark sidebar, they start with the main view, not a leftover settings screen.
