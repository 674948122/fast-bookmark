# Fix Bookmark Title Display Issue in Common/Recent Folders

The user reported a "display anomaly" with the bookmark names in the "Common Bookmarks" section. Based on the code analysis, this is likely a **Flexbox layout issue** within the `.fast-bookmark-result-header` container.

## Problem Analysis
In the new implementation for Common/Recent bookmarks, we wrap the title and path in a flex container:
```html
<div class="fast-bookmark-result-header">
    <span class="fast-bookmark-result-title">Title</span>
    <span class="fast-bookmark-result-path">Path</span>
</div>
```
However, the CSS for `.fast-bookmark-result-title` lacks `flex: 1` and `min-width: 0`. Without these properties:
1.  **Long Paths**: If the path is long, it can expand and compress the title into a tiny width or push it out of view.
2.  **Long Titles**: If the title is long, `text-overflow: ellipsis` might not trigger correctly inside a flex container without a constrained width.

## Proposed Solution (CSS Updates)
I will update `content.js` to modify the CSS string:

1.  **Update `.fast-bookmark-result-title`**:
    *   Add `flex: 1`: Allows the title to take up remaining space.
    *   Add `min-width: 0`: Critical for flex items to shrink below their content size (enabling ellipsis).
    *   Keep `white-space: nowrap`, `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`.

2.  **Update `.fast-bookmark-result-path`**:
    *   Add `flex-shrink: 0`: Prevent the path tag from being squashed too much.
    *   Add `max-width: 50%`: Prevent the path from taking up more than half the row, ensuring the title remains readable.
    *   Add `text-overflow: ellipsis` and `overflow: hidden` to the path as well, just in case it's extremely long.

## Verification
This CSS change will ensure that:
*   The title takes up the majority of the space.
*   The path is visible but capped at 50% width.
*   Both text elements properly truncate with ellipsis if space is tight.
