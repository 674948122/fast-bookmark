I will implement edit and delete functionality for bookmarks and folders, including a folder selection dropdown for moving bookmarks and a confirmation dialog for deletions.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Background Script (`background.js`)**:
    *   **Update `getBookmarkData`**: Modify it to return a flattened `folders` array (containing `id` and `title`) alongside the existing `tree` and `flattened` bookmarks. This will be used to populate the folder dropdown.
    *   **Add Message Listeners**:
        *   `deleteBookmark`: Handles deletion. Uses `chrome.bookmarks.removeTree` for folders (to ensure recursive deletion) and `chrome.bookmarks.remove` for individual bookmarks.
        *   `updateBookmark`: Handles updates. Calls `chrome.bookmarks.update` to rename. If a new `parentId` is provided (and different from the current one), calls `chrome.bookmarks.move` to change the folder.

2.  **Content Script (`content.js`)**:
    *   **State Management**: Update `fetchBookmarks` to receive and store the `folders` list.
    *   **UI - HTML Structure**:
        *   **Edit Modal**: Add a new modal (`#fast-bookmark-edit-modal`) containing:
            *   Input field for the name.
            *   Select dropdown for the parent folder (hidden when editing a folder).
            *   "Save" and "Cancel" buttons.
        *   **Delete Confirmation Modal**: Add a modal (`#fast-bookmark-delete-modal`) with a confirmation message and "Delete"/"Cancel" buttons.
    *   **UI - Row Actions**:
        *   Modify `renderNode` (tree view) and `doRender` (search view) to append an "Actions" container to each row.
        *   Add "Edit" (pencil icon) and "Delete" (trash icon) buttons to this container.
    *   **CSS Styles**:
        *   Style the new modals to match the existing design (dark/light mode support).
        *   Style the action buttons to appear on the right side of the row, visible on hover.
    *   **Event Handling**:
        *   **Edit Click**: Open the Edit Modal, pre-fill the name, and (for bookmarks) select the current parent folder in the dropdown.
        *   **Delete Click**: Open the Delete Confirmation Modal.
        *   **Save Logic**: Validate input, send `updateBookmark` message to background, and close modal.
        *   **Confirm Delete Logic**: Send `deleteBookmark` message to background and close modal.

This approach ensures a seamless user experience where changes are immediately reflected (via the existing `bookmarksChanged` listener) and data integrity is maintained.
