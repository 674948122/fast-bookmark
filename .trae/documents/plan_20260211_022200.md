# Recent Folder Internationalization & UI Cleanup Plan

I will fix the internationalization issue for the "Recently Visited" folder name and hide the edit/delete actions for this virtual folder.

## 1. Fix Internationalization (`content.js`)
- The issue is likely that `getMsg("recentFolder")` is called once during `processBookmarks` but might not be updating or using the correct language context if the language changes or if `i18n` logic has quirks.
- I will check `processBookmarks` to ensure it uses `getMsg` correctly.
- More importantly, I need to ensure that when the language setting changes, the folder title updates.
- **Action**: In `processBookmarks`, when creating the `recentNode`, I'll double-check it uses `getMsg("recentFolder")`.
- **Action**: In `renderResults`, I'll check if I need to re-translate the title dynamically, but usually `fetchBookmarks` (which calls `processBookmarks`) is re-called on save, so it should be fine. I'll verify the `i18n` object has the keys (I added them in a previous turn, but I'll double-check the keys match).

## 2. Hide Edit/Delete Actions (`content.js`)
- **Logic**: In `renderNode` (for tree view) and `doRender` (for search results), I need to check if the item is the "Recently Visited" folder or a child of it (if we want to restrict editing items *within* it, but the user specifically asked for "Recently Visited folder" itself).
- **Refinement**: The user said "最近访问没有编辑、删除功能" (Recently Visited has no edit/delete functions). This likely applies to the *folder itself* (`id === "fast-bookmark-recent"`).
- **Implementation**:
  - In `renderNode`, check `if (node.id === "fast-bookmark-recent")`. If true, do **not** append the `actions` div (or set it to `display: none` / empty).
  - Also, for items *inside* the recent folder, they are just references to real bookmarks. Editing them might be confusing (does it edit the original?). But the user specifically mentioned the "Recently Visited" *folder* (implied by "internal is bookmark visit history"). I will start by disabling actions for the **folder node itself**.
  - Wait, items inside are virtual copies (`{ ...item, parentId: "fast-bookmark-recent" }`). If I edit them, the `updateBookmark` action uses `id`. It *should* update the real bookmark. However, `deleteBookmark` might try to remove it from the virtual folder? No, `chrome.bookmarks.remove` works on ID. So editing/deleting children *might* work but could be risky/confusing.
  - **Decision**: I will strictly hide the actions for the **Recently Visited Folder Node** first. If the user meant the items inside too, I'll consider that, but usually, history items are just links. I'll hide actions for the folder itself as requested.

## 3. Verification
- Change language to English/Chinese -> Verify "Recently Visited" / "最近访问" updates.
- Hover over "Recently Visited" folder -> Verify no Edit/Delete buttons appear.
- Hover over other folders -> Verify Edit/Delete buttons still appear.
