I will add a language configuration option to the settings panel, allowing users to override the system default language.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Internationalization (i18n):**
    *   Add keys for "Language" (`languageLabel`), "Auto/System" (`languageAuto`), "English" (`languageEn`), and "Chinese" (`languageZh`) to `_locales/en/messages.json` and `_locales/zh_CN/messages.json`.
    *   **Note:** Since `chrome.i18n` is determined by the browser's locale and cannot be easily switched dynamically via API for a single extension view, we must implement a **manual i18n override** in `content.js`.
    *   We will store the selected language in `chrome.storage.sync`.
    *   We will create a helper function `getMessage(key)` in `content.js` that checks the stored language preference. If it's "auto", it falls back to `chrome.i18n.getMessage`. If it's a specific language, it uses a built-in dictionary (loaded from the `_locales` files or hardcoded for simplicity given the small number of keys, but loading is better).
    *   *Simplification*: To avoid complexity with loading JSONs dynamically, I will embed the translation strings directly in `content.js` or a new `i18n.js` file, OR simply reload the extension/page? No, that's bad UX.
    *   *Better Approach*: Use `chrome.i18n` for the *default* state, but if the user overrides it, we need to manually replace text content.
    *   I will create a `translations` object in `content.js` containing the strings for supported languages (en, zh_CN) to support instant switching without reloading.

2.  **Settings Management (`content.js`):**
    *   Update `settings` object to include `language: "auto"`.
    *   Update `loadSettings` and save logic.

3.  **UI Updates (`content.js`):**
    *   **Settings Modal**: Insert the "Language" setting row as the **first item**.
    *   **Control**: A select dropdown or radio group with options: "Auto", "English", "简体中文".

4.  **Logic (`content.js`):**
    *   Implement `updateTexts()` function: This function will traverse the DOM (or specific elements with `data-i18n` attributes) and update their `textContent` based on the current `settings.language`.
    *   When the language setting changes, call `updateTexts()` immediately to preview.
    *   On initialization, call `updateTexts()`.

**Plan Steps:**
1.  Define translation dictionaries in `content.js`.
2.  Update `_locales` for the new setting labels (for the "Auto" state).
3.  Modify `content.js` HTML to add the Language selector at the top of settings.
4.  Implement the language switching logic and text update mechanism.

*Self-Correction on i18n*: Since `chrome.i18n.getMessage` is static based on browser language, a custom implementation is required for dynamic switching. I will embed the necessary strings for EN and ZH_CN directly in `content.js` to ensure fast, synchronous switching.
