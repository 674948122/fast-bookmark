# Fix Oversized Settings Title

The user reports that the settings title (`h2` element) has become "huge".

## Problem Analysis
In `content.js`:
```javascript
<h2 style="color: var(--text-color);" data-i18n="settingsTitle">${getMsg("settingsTitle")}</h2>
```
I am injecting a style tag into the Shadow DOM. The global styles for `h2` inside the Shadow DOM might be inheriting user agent styles or being affected by some other CSS rule I added.

Looking at the CSS in `content.js`:
```css
      #fast-bookmark-settings-modal h2 {
        padding: 32px 32px 0 32px;
        margin: 0 0 24px 0;
        flex-shrink: 0;
      }
```
I haven't set a `font-size` for this specific `h2`.
However, I did set:
```css
      #fast-bookmark-sidebar-title {
        font-size: 20px;
        font-weight: 700;
        /* ... */
      }
```
The settings title is just an `h2` tag. User agent default for `h2` is usually `1.5em` (which is `24px` if base is `16px`).

If it appears "huge", it might be because the base font size is large, or some other rule is affecting it. Or perhaps the user simply finds the default `h2` size too large compared to the rest of the UI (which uses `14px` for labels).

## Solution
I should explicitly set the `font-size` for the settings title to match the sidebar title (`20px`) or slightly larger/smaller depending on design intent. `20px` seems appropriate for consistency.

I will update the CSS for `#fast-bookmark-settings-modal h2`.

## Plan
1.  Update `content.js`: Add `font-size: 20px;` and `font-weight: 700;` to `#fast-bookmark-settings-modal h2` CSS rule.
