I will modify `background.js` to allow the extension icon click to work on the launcher page (`launcher.html`) instead of opening a new tab.

1. **Modify** **`background.js`**:

   * In the `chrome.action.onClicked` listener, get the full URL of `launcher.html` using `chrome.runtime.getURL("launcher.html")`.

   * Update the restricted page check condition. Currently, it blocks all `chrome-extension://` URLs.

   * Add an exception to allow the current tab if its URL matches the launcher URL.

   * This will allow the execution flow to proceed to `chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, { action: "toggle" })`, which will trigger the `toggle()` function in `content.js`.

   * Since `content.js` already has logic to close the window when toggled off in launcher mode (`if (isLauncher) window.close()`), this will achieve the desired "collapse" behavior.
