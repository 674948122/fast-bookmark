# Fix "Recently Visited" Folder Internationalization Plan

I will fix the issue where the "Recently Visited" folder name appears as "Untitled" or is not localized correctly when the language is set to "Auto".

## 1. Update Locale Files
- **`_locales/en/messages.json`**:
  - Add `recentFolder`: "Recently Visited".
  - Update `showRecentLabel`: "Show Recently Visited" (for consistency).
- **`_locales/zh_CN/messages.json`**:
  - Add `recentFolder`: "最近访问".
  - Update `showRecentLabel`: "显示最近访问".

## 2. Verification
- Since I cannot interactively verify the "Auto" language setting (which depends on the browser locale), I will rely on the fact that adding these missing keys to the standard `messages.json` files resolves the `chrome.i18n.getMessage` failure that currently causes the title to be empty.
- This ensures that whether the user uses "Auto" or manually selects a language, the correct string is returned.
