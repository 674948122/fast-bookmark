I will add a star history chart to the bottom of the README.md file.

**Plan:**

1.  **Modify `README.md`**:
    *   Append a new section `## 🌟 Star History` at the end of the file.
    *   Insert the markdown code for the star history chart using the `https://api.star-history.com/svg` service.
    *   I will use the repository `pandegong/fast-bookmark` based on the project path context (assuming this is the GitHub repo name, if not, I'll use a placeholder or ask, but typically for personal projects it follows `user/repo`. Given the user path `/Users/pandegong/...`, `pandegong` is likely the username).

**Markdown to append:**

```markdown
## 🌟 Star History

<a href="https://star-history.com/#pandegong/fast-bookmark&Date">
 <picture>
   <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=pandegong/fast-bookmark&type=Date&theme=dark" />
   <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=pandegong/fast-bookmark&type=Date" />
   <img alt="Star History Chart" src="https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=pandegong/fast-bookmark&type=Date" />
 </picture>
</a>
```

(Note: I'm assuming the repo is `pandegong/fast-bookmark`. If the remote is different, I might need to check `git remote -v` first, but `LS` didn't show `.git` explicitly though it's likely there. I'll check for git config first to be precise, otherwise I'll use `pandegong/fast-bookmark` as a best guess.)
